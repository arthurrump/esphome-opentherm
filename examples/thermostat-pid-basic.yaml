# A basic thremostat for a boiler with a single central heating circuit and
# domestic hot water. It reports the flame, CH and DHW status, similar to what
# you would expect to see on a thermostat and also reports the internal boiler
# temperatures and the current modulation level. The temperature is regulated
# through a PID Climate controller and the current room temperature is retrieved
# from a sensor in Home Asisstant.

# This configuration should meet most needs and is the recommended starting
# point if you just want a thermostat with an external temperature sensor.
